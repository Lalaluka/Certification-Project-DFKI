Notable improvements: Question about Internet Drop at 1 o'clock RAG answers provided more valuable responses at times.
Same with the slower internet speed question.
More input sometimes confuses the LLM and leads to haluzination (but considering the small model thats not surprising).
So the result is a bit mixed. Specifically the Wikipedia Articles probably did not help, when the k for retrieved documents was decreased the overall quality increased, while the haluzinations decreased and no wikipedia articles were queried anymore.
